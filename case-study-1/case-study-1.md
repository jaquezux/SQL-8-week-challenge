# Danny's Dinner - The Taste of Success

<img src="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/images/case-study-designs/1.png" width='300' align='center'>

## Introduction
Danny's Dinner is a restaurant with a few months of operation. During this time, the restaurant has captured some basic data but don't know what to use it in their business strategies.

## The problem
Danny's Dinner wants to use their data to obtain some answers regarding his customers such as visit patterns, how much money they've spent and what are their favorites orders. By understanding better their customers, they will be able to provide a better and more personalized experience for their loyal customers.

Danny wants to use these insights as a guidance to the customer loyalty program.

He also needs help to generate basic datasets so his team can inspect the data withou using SQL.

## The data
Danny has provided a sample of his overall customer data and he hopes that this examples are enough to write SQL queries to help him answer the questions.

Here are the keys dataset Danny has shared with me:
- <code>sales</code>: captures all customer_id level purchases with an corresponding order_date and product_id information for when and what menu items were ordered.
- <code>menu</code>: maps the product_id to the actual product_name and price of each menu item.
- <code>members</code>: captures the join_date when a customer_id joined the beta version of the Dannyâ€™s Diner loyalty program.

## Case Study Questions
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
~~~sql
SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(m.price)
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m
USING (product_id)
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
~~~

| customer_id | sum |
| ----------- | --- |
| A           | 76  |
| B           | 74  |
| C           | 36  |

To answer this questions, I need two values: the customer IDs and the total amount each customer spent.
- To get this data, I used an INNER JOIN for <code>sales</code> and <code>menu</code> tables using <code>product_id</code> field.
- I used GROUP BY <code>customer_id</code> to get them separately.
- I used the SUM(<code>price</code>) to get the total amount spent by each customer.

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
~~~sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_date) AS days_visited
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
~~~

| customer_id | days_visited |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | 6            |
| B           | 6            |
| C           | 3            |

---

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

~~~sql
SELECT customer_id, product_name AS FirstItem
FROM (
      SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name,
      RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY m.product_name ORDER BY s.order_date) AS FirstOrder
      FROM dannys_diner.sales s
      INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
      USING (product_id)
      ORDER BY s.customer_id) AS t
WHERE FirstOrder = 1
GROUP BY t.customer_id, t.product_name;
~~~

| customer_id | firstitem |
| ----------- | --------- |
| A           | curry     |
| A           | sushi     |
| B           | curry     |
| C           | ramen     |


The first items A ordered was a sushi and a curry. B ordered a curry and C ordered a ramen!

---

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

~~~sql
SELECT m.product_name, COUNT(m.product_name) AS purchases
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m
USING (product_id)
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY purchases DESC;
~~~

| product_name | purchases |
| ------------ | --------- |
| ramen        | 8         |
| curry        | 4         |
| sushi        | 3         |

Ramen is the most purchased item. It was ordered 8 times.

---

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

~~~sql
SELECT customer_id, product_name AS favoriteitem
  FROM (
    SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name,
    	RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(s.order_date) DESC) as RankItem
    FROM dannys_diner.sales s
    INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
    USING(product_id)
    GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name) t
WHERE rankitem = 1;
~~~

| customer_id | favoriteitem |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | ramen        |
| B           | ramen        |
| B           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |
| C           | ramen        |

The most popular item for customers A and C is ramen. Customer B may not have a popular item, because all of the items were ordered twice.

---

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

~~~sql
SELECT customer_id, JoinFirstOrder AS firstitem
FROM (
  SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m2.join_date,
    CASE
      WHEN s.customer_id = 'A' AND s.order_date > m2.join_date THEN m1.product_name
      WHEN s.customer_id = 'B' AND s.order_date > m2.join_date THEN m1.product_name
    END AS JoinFirstOrder,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS Rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales as s
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu as m1
  USING (product_id)
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members as m2
  USING (customer_id)) t
WHERE JoinFirstOrder IS NOT NULL and Rank=4
ORDER BY Rank;
~~~
| customer_id | firstitem |
| ----------- | --------- |
| A           | ramen     |
| B           | sushi     |

After joining the fidelity program, A's first order was ramen and B's first order was sushi.

---

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

~~~sql
SELECT customer_id, JoinLastOrder AS last_item
FROM (
  SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m2.join_date,
    CASE
      WHEN s.customer_id = 'A' AND s.order_date < m2.join_date THEN m1.product_name
      WHEN s.customer_id = 'B' AND s.order_date < m2.join_date THEN m1.product_name
    END AS JoinLastOrder,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS Rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales as s
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu as m1
  USING (product_id)
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members as m2
  USING (customer_id)) t
  WHERE JoinLastOrder IS NOT NULL AND Rank=4
ORDER BY Rank;
~~~

| customer_id | last_item |
| ----------- | --------- |
| A           | sushi     |
| A           | curry     |
| B           | sushi     |


Before joining the fidelity program, A's last order was sushi and curry, B's last order was sushi.

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

~~~sql
SELECT s.customer_id, COUNT(s.order_date) AS total_items, SUM(m1.price) AS total_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m1
USING (product_id)
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members AS m2
USING (customer_id)
WHERE s.order_date < m2.join_date
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
~~~

| customer_id | total_items | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 2           | 25          |
| B           | 3           | 40          |

---

**9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**

~~~sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(price_with_points) AS points
  FROM (
    SELECT s.customer_id,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN s.product_id=1 THEN m1.price*20
        ELSE m1.price*10
    END) AS price_with_points
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m1
  USING (product_id)
  GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.product_id
  ORDER BY s.customer_id) as t
GROUP BY customer_id;
~~~

| customer_id | points |
| ----------- | ------ |
| A           | 860    |
| B           | 940    |
| C           | 360    |

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

To answer this questions we have to consider 3 periods:
1) When customers didn't joined the program, and only sushi had 2x points.
2) The first week customers joined the program and all items had 2x points.
3) The second week after customers joined the program, and only sushi had 2x points again.


a) Let's start with the period when customers didn't joined the program yet. Only sushi has the 2x points multiplier.

~~~sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
	SUM(CASE
      WHEN s.product_id=1 THEN m1.price*20
      ELSE m1.price*10
	END) AS price_with_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m1
USING (product_id)
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members AS m2
USING (customer_id)
WHERE order_date < join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.product_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
~~~

| customer_id | points |
| ----------- | ------ |
| A           | 350    |
| B           | 500    |

b) Now, moving to the first week after customers joined the program. All items has 2x points multiplier, not only sushi.

- Every $1 equates to 10 points.
- All items have 2x multiplier.
~~~sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(price_with_points)
  FROM (SELECT *,
    CASE 
      WHEN order_date >= join_date THEN price*20
      ELSE m1.price*10
    END AS price_with_points
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m1
  USING (product_id)
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members as m2
  USING (customer_id)
  WHERE s.order_date >= m2.join_date 
  AND s.order_date <= m2.join_date + INTERVAL '6 DAY'  
  ORDER BY customer_id, order_date) AS t
GROUP BY customer_id;
~~~

| customer_id | sum  |
| ----------- | ---- |
| A           | 1020 |
| B           | 200  |

c) Then, the second week after customers joined the program. Again, only sushi has 2x points multiplier:

~~~sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
	SUM(CASE
      WHEN s.product_id=1 THEN m1.price*20
      ELSE m1.price*10
	END) AS price_with_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m1
USING (product_id)
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members AS m2
USING (customer_id)
WHERE order_date > join_date + INTERVAL '6 day'
	AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) =1  
GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.product_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id
~~~

| customer_id | points  |
| ----------- | ------- |
| B           | 200     |

To get the final result and total points, let's sum all 3 tables. I'm using CTE to make an UNION ALL.

~~~sql
WITH not_member AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, s.product_id, s.order_date,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN s.product_id=1 THEN m1.price*20
        ELSE m1.price*10
    END) AS points
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m1
  USING (product_id)
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members AS m2
  USING (customer_id)
  WHERE order_date < join_date
  GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.product_id, s.order_date
),

first_week_member AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, s.product_id, s.order_date,
    CASE 
      WHEN order_date >= join_date THEN price*20
      ELSE m1.price*10
    END AS points
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m1
  USING (product_id)
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members as m2
  USING (customer_id)
  WHERE s.order_date >= m2.join_date 
  AND s.order_date <= m2.join_date + INTERVAL '6 DAY'  
  ORDER BY customer_id, order_date
),

second_week_member AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, s.product_id, s.order_date,
	SUM(CASE
      WHEN s.product_id=1 THEN m1.price*20
      ELSE m1.price*10
	END) AS price_with_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m1
USING (product_id)
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members AS m2
USING (customer_id)
WHERE order_date > join_date + INTERVAL '6 day'
	AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) =1  
GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.product_id, s.order_date
ORDER BY s.customer_id
)


SELECT customer_id, SUM(points)
  FROM (
    SELECT * FROM not_member 
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT * FROM first_week_member 
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT * FROM second_week_member
  ) as t
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
~~~

| customer_id | sum  |
| ----------- | ---- |
| A           | 1370 |
| B           | 820  |
